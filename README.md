## Project Description

### Overview:

A mini stock market simulator, where users battle each other through their stock portfolios.

#### How does it work?
After creating an account, users can buy stocks to grow their total net worth. Afterward, that user can see other users' accounts and decide to battle them. Battling other investors means your portfolio goes head to head with theirs and whoever has a better portfolio wins.

## Requirements

Your **minimum requirements** for this project are:

1. You should have at least five models. You do not have to have all of these built out on day one. But by the end of the week, you should have at least five models.

2. Some methods in your models. There should be at least twenty methods total in your models. These are to be used to better extract data from your tables. Think Flatiron BnB Lab

3. No APIs until you get approval from an instructor
4. Specs - there should be at least 10 specs in your project (five per person).

5. No JavaScript. Stay focused on Rails for this project - we'll have plenty of time this semester to cover JS topics.
